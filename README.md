  Problem statement: Interpreters introduce a high number of indirect
  branches.  According to [1] branch predictors at around 2000, were
  not able to predict accurately those type of branches. In our
  project we are going to examine if this statement holds also for
  today's branch predictors.  [1]  M. Anton Ertl , David Gregg, The
  Structure and Performance of Efficient Interpreters.

#  Interpreted Languages to be tested are (possibly):
  1. JavaScript : https://www.javascript.com/
  2. Java       : https://www.java.com/en/
  3. Python     : https://www.python.org/	
  4. CLI (Common Language Infrastructure [e.g C#]) : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_CLI_languages 


#  Graphs for our evaluation
  1. Prediction Accuracy: Miss Predict rate of different interpreters
     over branch predictors
  2. Effect on execution time : Execution time of different
     interpreters over branch predictors

#  Architectures to be tested 
  1. Intel  : Haswell(2013) (sith), Skylake(2015) (ManosPC),
     Core 2 (2006) (JackPC), Nehalem(2008) (-), Ivy Bridge(2012)
     (jedi8)
  2. AMD    : AMD64 family15h (hydra)

## OProfile
  OProfile is an open source project that includes a statistical
  profiler for Linux systems, capable of profiling all running code at
  low overhead. In version 0.9.9, an event counting tool, ocount, was
  added to the project. OProfile is released under the GNU GPL. It has
  proven stable over a large number of differing configurations; it is
  being used on machines ranging from laptops to 16-way NUMA-Q boxes.
  As always, there is no warranty.
