1. BR_INST_EXEC	Counts the number of near branch instructions executed, but not necessarily retired.	

0x01: (name=cond) Counts the number of conditional near branch instructions executed, but not necessarily retired 
0x02: (name=direct) Counts all unconditional near branch instructions excluding calls and indirect branches 
0x04: (name=indirect_non_call) Counts the number of executed indirect near branch instructions that are not calls 


2. BR_MISP_EXEC	Counts the number of mispredicted conditional near branch instructions executed, but not necessarily retired.	

0x01: (name=cond) Counts the number of mispredicted conditional near branch instructions executed, but not necessarily retired 
0x02: (name=direct) Counts mispredicted macro unconditional near branch instructions, excluding calls and indirect branches (should always be 0) 
0x04: (name=indirect_non_call) Counts the number of executed mispredicted indirect near branch instructions that are not calls 


3. BR_INST_RETIRED	number of branch instructions retired	

0x00: (name=all_branches) See Table A-1 
0x01: (name=conditional) Counts the number of conditional branch instructions retired  
0x04: (name=all_branches) Counts the number of branch instructions retired 

4. BR_MISS_PRED_RETIRED	number of mispredicted branches retired (precise)	
0x00: (name=all_branches) See Table A-1
