we were not able to calculate MPKB because oprof for nehalem provides BR_INST_EXEC:0x30-> Counts all near call branches executed, but not necessarily retire

which is different from all other intel generations. For instance BR_INST_EXEC:0xff for ivy-bridge-> counts all branch instructions executed.
